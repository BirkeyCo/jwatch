Add the ability to manage jobs in the quartz system.

Jobs can be paused, deleted, and run immediately.  To support this, the current
status of the processing status of the job, as aggregated from the triggers has
been added to the display.

The display of all dates and times are now in the browser time zone.

The configuration files have been moved from the users home directory to a
specified location on the file system.  This will probably require changes
in your installation.

The columns on the executed jobs and the scheduled jobs have been customized
in content and size for our environment.
